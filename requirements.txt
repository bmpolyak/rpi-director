# Dependencies for Raspberry Pi LED Director
# 
# RECOMMENDED: Install via system packages (APT) instead of pip:
#   sudo apt install python3-paho-mqtt python3-rpi.gpio
#
# System packages provide better compatibility and the correct RPi.GPIO version (0.7.2)
# with working edge detection support.

# MQTT library for network communication
paho-mqtt>=1.6.0

# Raspberry Pi GPIO library
# Note: System package python3-rpi.gpio (version 0.7.2) is preferred
# Pip version 0.7.1 has edge detection issues
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0
